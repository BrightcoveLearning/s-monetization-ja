    <p>If a package is no longer needed you have two options:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Unpublish</strong>: You can unpublish a package that will be needed again. For instance, you have a special package associated with a holiday that you will use year after year. This is a good use case for unpublish.</li>
      <li><strong>Delete</strong>: You can delete a package and it is not recoverable. For instance, you have an introductory package for a new set of content, but that content will not be new again, so you will not need the package again. This is a good use case for delete.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There are two places you can unpublish/delete a package:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>From the <strong>SVOD/AuthVOD Plans</strong> section check the package(s) you wish to unpublish/delete then click the appropriate button.<figure class="bcls-figure">

      <li>If you are editing the package, from the <strong>Package</strong> tab you can both unpublish and delete. Use the <strong>Status</strong> to unpublish or the <strong>Delete</strong> button to delete.
