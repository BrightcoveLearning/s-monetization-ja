    <h2 id="Overview">Overview</h2>
    <p>It is necessary for the provider of the video content and/or merchandise to setup an endpoint so Brightcove Beacon can notify the provider that a purchase is completed. When an in-app purchase is made through a Brightcove Beacon app, the app communicates with one of the platform stores, like the Apple App Store, to complete the purchase. Defined endpoints will receive a notification of this transaction.</p>
    <!-- <p>By default the supplier of the video content (and possibly other merchandise) purchased is not notified.</p> -->
    <p>Let's look at an example that demonstrates the flow from purchase to notification. The fictional company, Acme Symphony, has implemented an endpoint. A viewer using a Brightcove Beacon app on iOS makes a purchase. Here is the high-level workflow:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A viewer purchases a subscription for access to videos of past symphonies, and tickets for the upcoming summer season of live concerts.</li>
      <li>The Beacon app completes the purchase through the Apple App Store.</li>
      <li>The Beacon app notifies Beacon of the purchase.</li>
      <li>The Beacon entitlement subsystem grants the viewer access to all video assets in the purchased subscription.</li>
      <li>A notification is sent to Acme Symphony's endpoint.</li>
      <li>Acme Symphony knows of the purchase and is able to trigger additional workflows like sending tickets to the purchaser.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The rest of the document clarifies the technical implementation and provides specifics for implementing your endpoint.</p>

    <p>Here is a high-level diagram of the process:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) is a managed service that provides message delivery from publishers to subscribers. For full details see Amazon's <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/welcome.html">SNS Developer Guide</a>.</li>
      <li>After the notification is received by you, the Brightcove Beacon customer, the actions will vary. In the example, since tickets were purchased, the tickets would need to be sent. So once the notification is received, your business rules will determine what must occur.</li>
      <li>The endpoint implementation approach is entirely your decision. The decision will most likely be guided by backend technologies used and skills of your software engineers.</li>
      <li>The dashed line from the platform stores directly to the Brightcove Beacon backend is for other notifications, like renewals.</li>

    <h2 id="Notification_usage_guidelines">Notification usage guidelines</h2>
    <p>The following specify usage guidelines for notifications:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Notifications of in-app purchases from following stores is supported:
        <ul>
          <li>Apple App Store (iOS and AppleTV)</li>
          <li>Google Play (Android and Android TV)</li>
          <li>Roku Channel Store</li>
          <li>Amazon Appstore (FireTV)</li>
          <li>Stripe (Web and Samsung TV)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Beacon will report all purchase related events, including the following actions on subscriptions:
        <ul>
          <li>New</li>
          <li>Renewal</li>
          <li>Cancellation</li>
          <li>Applicable to Google Play only:
            <ul>
              <li>Pause</li>
              <li>Hold</li>
              <li>Resume</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Enough information is provided in the notification so the external store is able to apply entitlements and/or prevent purchases of the same asset (subscription) if already purchased through Beacon or native stores.</li>
      <li>Purchase events are delivered to external stores after receiving notification from source stores. This typically happens in under 5 minutes (usually within seconds). </li>
    </ul>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="API_endpoint_specifications">API endpoint specifications</h2>
    <p>After successfully processing a subscription in the Beacon system, Beacon will deliver an SNS topic message to a configured API endpoint specific for a particular customer.</p>
    <p>Following are the requirements for the external end point:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The API endpoint must be compatible with AWS SNS integration. See Amazon's <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-http-https-endpoint-as-subscriber.html">Fanout to HTTP/S endpoints</a> document for more details. This document contains a link to an implementation of an endpoint that processes Amazon SNS HTTP POST requests, written as a Java servlet.</li>
      <li>The API endpoint must be open to range of IP addresses used by AWS - see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-ip-ranges.html">AWS IP address ranges</a>.</li>
      <li>The API endpoint will go through a subscription confirmation step. See Amazon's <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/SendMessageToHttp.confirm.html">Confirm the subscription</a> document for more details.</li>
      <li>The API endpoint will need to unescape the JSON in the message field of the notification. See Amazon's <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-message-and-json-formats.html">Parsing message formats</a> document for more details.</li>
      <li>The API endpoint must verify the signature and provenance of the message. See Amazon's <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-verify-signature-of-message.html">Verifying the signatures of Amazon SNS messages</a> document for more details.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To be able to recover from errors, it is possible to re-send all purchases for a user (filtering any non active notifications). The store's external API endpoint is responsible for re-processing all messages, even if those were previously consumed.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--warning language-editable">Notes:
      <ul>
        <li>It is possible to generate an infinite loop of notifications. For instance, Beacon sends the IAP notification to the end point, the receiver creates a user and sends a <em>create entitlement</em> message to Beacon, which in turn sends an IAP notification to the receiver, and an infinite loop is started. When implementing your endpoint you must be sure not to allow this to happen.</li>
        <li>SNS queues do not have a retention period. We have a 3x 20s retry policy and then the message is moved to a dead letter queue. The dead-letter queue has a retention period of 14 days. However, the customer can force the sync either via beacon admin UI or via the API.
          <p>Brightcove can provide a file you can use to force the sync for all users, or you can use the API directly.</p>
      </ul>
